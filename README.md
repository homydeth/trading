repo for jupyter notebooks for testing trading systems
This repo contains Python notebooks for Monte Carlo testing of trading systems. 
The Trading_System_Model script takes a series of trades represented as R-multiples
and generates performance statistics from the Monte Carlo simulation. The
Trading_System_Portfolio_Test script takes an input file of actual trades and
runs portfolio based Monte Carlo simulations to determine what would happen if the system was traded
with different amounts of capital and position sizing rules.
